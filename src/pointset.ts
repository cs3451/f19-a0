// The PointSet class needs to be created here.
// 
// PointSet should be implemented as a circular buffer of fixed size 
// (the size is fixed at compile time), and when the buffer is full and a new point is added
// it overwrites the oldest point.  
//
// The key feature of a cicular buffer is that internally, it is implemented with an array,
// and with a "start" and "count" indices that show you were the first element is, and how many
// elements are in the buffer.  When the buffer is full, "count" is the size of the array.
// 
// When an element is removed from either end of the buffer, the "start" and "count" indices are 
// updated.  When a new element is added, "count" is incremented.  When an element is added to 
// a full buffer, the oldest element is overwritten (and the "start" is incremented).
// 
// Care must be taken to deal with wrapping around the end.
//
// You should implement these methods, at least:
//      addPoint(m: MousePosition) { ... }           // add a new point, overwritting the oldest if full
//   	dropPoint() { ... }                          // remove the oldest point
//  	get length(): number { ... }                 // get the current count
//  	getPoint(i: number): MousePosition { ... }   // get point number "i" (not array element "i")
